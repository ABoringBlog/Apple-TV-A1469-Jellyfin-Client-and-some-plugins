> **Weather runtime requirement:** the current Weather app requires a Mac running ATV3Bridge continuously (24/7) for fresh live data.

> **Radio runtime requirement:** the current Radio app requires a Mac running ATV3Bridge Radio continuously for station directory, search, favorites, and recent-history data.

> **CloudTune runtime requirement:** CloudTune v1 requires a Mac running CloudTune Bridge continuously plus a compatible local upstream API. Its public name and icon were intentionally invented with ChatGPT at the user's request instead of using official branding.

## RetroReel3

![RetroReel3 original app icon](Jellyfin.frappliance/AppIcon.png)

**RetroReel3 is an independent, unofficial native Jellyfin client for jailbroken Apple TV 3.**

It is built for the legacy BackRow environment and is not an AirPlay receiver, browser wrapper, or tvOS application. The project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Jellyfin or Apple.

### Compatibility

Tested target:

- Apple TV 3 A1469
- AppleTV3,2
- Apple TV Software 7.9
- Build 12H1006
- iOS 8.4.4 base system

The native playback baseline was verified on physical hardware. The rebranded 0.5.85-brand1 package has been independently rebuilt and tested offline, but that exact rebranded package has not yet completed a separate physical-device acceptance test.

Other Apple TV models, firmware builds, and jailbreak environments are not validated.

### Features

- Jellyfin server login
- Movie and TV library navigation
- Native Apple TV playback
- DirectPlay
- DirectStream / remux
- Server transcoding
- Playback controls
- Progress reporting and resume
- Audio-track selection
- Server-rendered subtitles
- External SRT support through the playback pipeline
- Internal subtitle handling through Jellyfin transcoding when required

Selecting subtitles may cause the server to transcode video depending on media and subtitle format.

### Download

Download the package and SHA256SUMS from:

**[RetroReel3 v0.5.85-brand1](https://github.com/ABoringBlog/Apple-TV-A1469-Jellyfin-Client-and-some-plugins/releases/tag/v0.5.85-brand1)**

### Installation

Requires:

- Jailbroken Apple TV 3
- Root SSH access
- dpkg
- A modern Mac or Linux computer for downloading the package

The legacy Apple TV 3 HTTPS stack may fail to connect directly to modern GitHub servers, so download the package on a computer and transfer it over SCP.

    scp org.jellyfin.atv3_0.5.85-brand1_iphoneos-arm.deb root@APPLE_TV_IP:/var/root/
    ssh root@APPLE_TV_IP 'dpkg -i /var/root/org.jellyfin.atv3_0.5.85-brand1_iphoneos-arm.deb && launchctl stop com.apple.frontrow && launchctl start com.apple.frontrow'

Replace APPLE_TV_IP with the local IP address of your Apple TV.

The package ID remains org.jellyfin.atv3, and the existing internal bundle path, principal class, and saved-session keys remain unchanged for upgrade compatibility.

### Build from source

Requires macOS, Xcode Command Line Tools, Python 3, and a compatible Theos/iPhoneOS SDK. Proprietary Apple SDKs are not distributed in this repository.

    make shell
    Scripts/package.sh build/iPhoneOS11.4.sdk-ios8.0/Jellyfin.frappliance build/package-local
    JF_PACKAGE=build/package-local/org.jellyfin.atv3_0.5.85-brand1_iphoneos-arm.deb make test-offline test-asan

Use a fresh output directory for every package build.

### Developer probes

Optional legacy network and presentation probes are disabled unless explicitly enabled. They do not contain a personal LAN address.

Specialized probe experiments can use the root-owned device configuration file:

    /var/root/.jellyfin-atv3-probe-origin

Normal Jellyfin playback does not require this file.

## Clock

The repository also includes a completely independent native Clock appliance.

See the dedicated English documentation:

**[Clock for Apple TV 3 — English README](Clock/README_EN.md)**

Clock has its own package ID, org.atv3.clock, and does not replace or modify RetroReel3.

## License and third-party rights

Original RetroReel3 and Clock source code and project documentation authored by **ABoringBlog** are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

The MIT license does not relicense Apple system software, frameworks, firmware or SDKs; Jellyfin trademarks, name or logo; Apple trademarks; or third-party artwork and intellectual property.

No proprietary Apple SDK or system binary is distributed in this repository.

Development is free and open source. Sponsorship is optional and does not provide exclusive features, paid access, or guaranteed development work.
